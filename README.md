# weather-forecast-app
Weather forecast fetcher using a simple zip code.

This project is a collaborative effort intended for a few reasons:

  • Work collaboratively via GitHub for version control, cloning and merging.
  
  • Learn to integrate Python and React on a lightweight app interface.
  
  • Add a project to our portfolios that demonstrates teamwork and team-based learning.

This project's front end is coded in React, and API calls and handling are coded with Python. 
While this could be much easier to accomplish simple in Javascript, the point is to learn to 
integrate two different technologies in a usable stack.
